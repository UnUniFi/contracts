# Basic Spec

## Concern

One of the remaining concerns is how to distribute (calculate) reward in proportion to the depositor's share.

1. Create contract instance using contract creation factory-like feature if cosmwasm has it and set contracts for each user which has funcitons to join, exit fund and retrieve reward

2. make users sign txs to instantiate contract which has join, exit fund and retrieve reward on Osmosis and create ibc-channel for each contract with one original contract (?) on UnUniFi
